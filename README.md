[![Gitter chat](https://img.shields.io/gitter/room/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-python)](https://gitter.im/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python)[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib)

The Python auto-instrumentation libraries for [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) (per [OTEP 0001](https://github.com/open-telemetry/oteps/blob/master/text/0001-telemetry-without-manual-instrumentation.md))

### Installation

This repository includes installable packages for each instrumented library. Libraries that produce telemetry data should only depend on `opentelemetry-api`,
and defer the choice of the SDK to the application developer. Applications may
depend on `opentelemetry-sdk` or another package that implements the API.

**Please note** that these libraries are currently in _beta_, and shouldn't
generally be used in production environments.

The
[`instrumentation/`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/tree/master/instrumentation)
directory includes OpenTelemetry instrumentation packages, which can be installed
separately as:

```sh
pip install opentelemetry-instrumentation-{integration}
```

To install the development versions of these packages instead, clone or fork
this repo and do an [editable
install](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs):

```sh
pip install -e ./ext/opentelemetry-ext-{integration}
```
